                <p>It is Wild Gunman. (He walks over to the game.) How do you play this thing? Let me show you kid. (He takes his hat off and throws it on top of the game.) I'm a crack shot at
                    this. (Marty fires at the game and sure enough, he's a crack shot. The words "Crack Shot" appear on the screen.) (surprised) You mean you have to use your hands?</p>
                <p>What about the locomotive? Grinning. It'll be a spectacular wreck. Too bad no one will be around to see it. (os) Ahhh!! help me! (Doc turns around and spots a woman on a
                    buckboard that's gone out of control. He jumps on his horse.) Great Scott! (he takes off after her) Git!</p>
                <p> (to Doc) Thank you...for taking care of my telescope. You're quite welcome. (Clara leaves and Doc stands there with this puppy love look on his face. Marty walks over to him after
                    a moment.) It's a nice telescope. (Clock Tower)</p>

                <p>How do ya figure? My horse threw his shoe. Seein' you was the one who done the shoeing, I figures you was responsible. Well since you never paid me for the job I say that makes us
                    even! Wrong! See I was on my horse when he threw his shoe and I got throwed off. And that just caused me to bust a perfectly good bottle of fine Kentucky Redeye. So the way I
                    figure, blacksmith, you owe me five dollars for the whiskey, and seventy-five dollars for the horse. (realizing) That's eighty dollars!</p>
                <p> No, you just got to have the right touch. Nobody can start this car but me. The bill comes to $302 and 57 cents... 300 bucks? (He gets out of the car.) 300 bucks for a couple of
                    dents? No, hey, that's bullshit Terry. No Biff, it was horseshit, the whole car was filled with it. (We cut to 2015 Biff as he remembers this.)</p>
