            <p>A girl that exudes a larger than life, cute and friendly charm, who seems like the type to sincerely say she wants to make a million friends. Her demeanor might mostly be for show,
                hiding the parts she dislikes about herself from the world, but her reasons for it aren’t! She is happy to please and loves getting attention, especially for her looks which she
                has spent so much time and effort trying to achieve, she knows she looks good now but she still wants you to say it (Just don't look at her family photo album). She is friendly
                and open with most anyone but once you get close enough she is yours for life, and trust me it's not that difficult.</p>
            <p>Only problem is once you get close enough with her she starts to worry if you will stay by her side and gets overly upset over small things, and thinking up the worst possible
                scenarios for why you might have come to hate her even when you don't, which usually if there is any problems that is the root of it all, she is so soft though that she mostly
                just mopes about it in her room when her thoughts or life trouble her like that. Also despite wanting to make everyone happy and in awe with her, this wont stop her from trying
                her best to aim for what she wants even if it means getting a bit competitive. </p>
            <p>She maintains a high standard of aesthetics for herself, feeling that looks are important to making people like you, this doesn't mean she breaks the bank over it though since a
                high-schooler only gets so much money, no, she makes sure to use what she has to it's full potential finding and unveiling the beauty in even old thrift store clothing and coming
                up with a showy but cute look.</p>

            <p>By just pending a good amount of her time revamping & repairing clothes she owns or thrifted to suit her current tastes she has managed to spread her pocket-money out.</p>
            <h4>Horror</h4>
